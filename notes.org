* Testing strategy
- Generate 16 kB? of test noise
* Nucleo-32
  - Remove SB9 or the onboard ST-Link will hold RST low (allows power via 3v3 pin)
  - The power board's trigger pin is D7. I either had to remove SB5 and SB7 and place SB6, or connect another pin to D7 with a wire (I used D3/PB0 for convenience). D7/PC14 and D8/PC15 by default are connected to LSE (external oscillator X1).
